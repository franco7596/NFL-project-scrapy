## NFL Scrapy project
I'm thrilled to announce that my latest project, which I worked on solo, is now live and accessible to everyone! This is a web scraping application that I built using the Scrapy framework to extract all the relevant information about teams and players from the official [NFL website](https://www.nfl.com/). With this application, I have collected comprehensive data on team statistics, player profiles, and even team logos.

The data collected by the web scraping application is then stored in a database managed by the backend that I created. On the frontend, users can access this information through my user-friendly interface. They can view team statistics, filter teams and players by text or a range of different filters, and see all player statistics.

I'm proud of the hard work I put into this project, and I'm excited to see it in action. The web scraping application is deployed on AWS, using the Scrapyrt library to manage HTTP requests and deliver information to the NFL application backend in JSON format.

You can check out my project on GitHub, where you'll find all the code for the application. I hope my web scraping application will help NFL enthusiasts keep up with their favorite teams and players. Give it a try and let me know what you think!
